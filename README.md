# Matlab-2048
A fully functional recreation of the game 2048 in Matlab. Useful for others as an educational resource.

I made this for my CS1371 class at GaTech but it was a pain in the butt so I am posting it here. This project is meant to be used as a tool to learn how to create GUIs in Matlab and work with the object-oriented aspect of Matlab GUIs. The Wiki page has a much more detailed look at the project.
